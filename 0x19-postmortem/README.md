Postmortem: Outage of Web Services

Issue Summary:

    Duration: The outage occurred from May 5th, 2024, at 3:00 PM (UTC) to May 6th, 2024, at 9:00 AM (UTC), lasting approximately 18 hours.
    Impact: The outage affected our primary web services, causing complete unavailability for all users during the incident period. Approximately 80% of our user base was unable to access the platform, leading to significant disruption and loss of service.
    Root Cause: The outage was caused by a database failure due to a misconfiguration during routine maintenance, resulting in the inability of the application servers to retrieve essential data, leading to service degradation and eventual unavailability.

Timeline:

    May 5th, 2024, 3:00 PM (UTC): Issue detected through monitoring alerts indicating a sudden spike in database errors.
    May 5th, 2024, 3:15 PM (UTC): Engineering team notified and began investigating the root cause.
    May 5th, 2024, 3:45 PM (UTC): Initial assumption made that the database errors were due to increased traffic. Scaling measures implemented, but issue persisted.
    May 5th, 2024, 5:30 PM (UTC): Misleading assumption made that a recent code deployment might have caused the issue. Rollback attempted, but no improvement observed.
    May 5th, 2024, 8:00 PM (UTC): Incident escalated to senior engineering management for further assistance.
    May 5th, 2024, 10:00 PM (UTC): Root cause identified as a database misconfiguration during maintenance.
    May 6th, 2024, 3:00 AM (UTC): Database configuration reverted to the last known stable state, restoring service availability.
    May 6th, 2024, 9:00 AM (UTC): Services fully restored and confirmed stable.

Root Cause and Resolution:

    Root Cause: The database failure was caused by a misconfiguration error during routine maintenance tasks, leading to the disruption of data retrieval processes.
    Resolution: The issue was resolved by reverting the database configuration to the last known stable state, restoring the functionality of essential data retrieval processes and service availability.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

    Improvements/Fixes:
        Strengthening monitoring systems to detect configuration changes and anomalies in real-time.
        Implementing stricter change management procedures for database configurations.
    Tasks to Address the Issue:
        Review and update maintenance procedures to include thorough testing and validation of configuration changes.
        Conduct a post-incident review to identify additional vulnerabilities and implement necessary safeguards.
        Enhance communication channels for timely escalation and collaboration during critical incidents.
